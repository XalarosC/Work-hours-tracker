#### Description:
The Work Hours Tracker is a simple Python application designed to help users manage their work hours effectively. It allows users to log their work hours for different dates, calculate the total hours worked, and even delete recorded working hours when needed.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
4. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```
   python project.py
   ```

### Functionality:
- **Add Work Hours:**
  - Enter the date, start time, and end time to log your work hours. The application will save this information for future reference.

- **Calculate Total Hours:**
  - Use the 'payday' option to calculate the total hours worked and the corresponding salary based on an hourly rate. This feature provides users with a quick overview of their earnings.

- **Delete Working Hours:**
  - In case of any errors or inaccuracies, users can use the 'delete' option to remove all recorded working hours. This helps maintain accurate records and ensures data integrity.

### How to Test:
To ensure the reliability and correctness of the application, you can run tests using pytest. Follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have pytest installed on your system (`pip install pytest`).
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the project files and tests are located.
4. Run the following command:
   ```
   pytest test_project.py
   ```
   This will execute the test suite and provide feedback on the functionality of the application.
